## Objectives
The objective of this project was to analyze the distribution and accessibility of urban green spaces in
the city of Curitiba. This is an excericise in order to familiarize onself with the basic elements of Git and PGAdmin along with analysis of spatial data through querying in a PostGIS-enabled PostgreSQL database.
### Tools and Methods
PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
pgAdmin (for database management)
QGIS
Git (Hub and Bash)
For my methods, I first gathered data from extract.BBBike.org. Then I queryied the data to find out the areas of greenspaces and of the municipality of CUritiba. Lastly I used QGIS to visualize the data.
### Findings
I found tha the top 5 largest parks in the data are Parque das Aguas, Parque Newton Puppi, Parque Nautico, Parque Pinhal do Santana and Parque Barigui. The total area of parks in the dataset is 20,800,137.01.
